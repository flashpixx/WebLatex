WebLatex
========

A CMS system for creating LaTeX documents with PDF rendering with a browser interface only.
Document management options like group editing, draft structure, tag cloud are also within the system
Under http://flashpixx.de/2012/05/weblatex/ you can find some information about the projekt (at the moment only in german.)

The system should migrate to http://etherpad.org/
